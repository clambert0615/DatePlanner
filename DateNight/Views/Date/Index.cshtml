    <h3>First Date Quizzes</h3>
    Before going on a first date, it is always good to know your love personality and get help with what to wear.
    The following two quizzes will help you to prepare for a first date in order to ensure a second date! <br />

<h3>Unsure what to do?</h3>
<p>
    Planning the perfect date is always difficult, especially if you don't really know the other person.  How about
    looking for an event, movie, activity or restaurant.

<div class="row">
    <div class="column">
        <h5>Events</h5>

        Going to an event is always a fun idea.  From a music concert to a sports game, there is always something to do! <br />
        <button onclick="location.href='/Date/EventIndex'" style="background-color:lightblue">Events</button>
        <br />
        <br />
  
        <h5>Movies</h5>

        Movies are always a safe bet.  Many first dates start with a movie and seeing a movie is perfect if you are shy
        or really don't know your date's interests.<br />
        <button onclick="location.href='/Date/MovieIndex'" style="background-color:lightblue">Movies</button>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
        <h5>Activities</h5>

        If you prefer something a little more active and know some of your date's interests, an activity is the perfect
        date for you. You can go compete in a game of bowling or golf, go to a museum, go to the beach, or whatever other
        activity you can think of.<br />
        <button onclick="location.href='/Date/ActivityIndex'" style="background-color:lightblue">Activities</button>
   <br />
        <br />
        <h5>Restaurants</h5>

        No date is complete without something to eat. Either before you go see that movie or after a game of bowling,
        going to a restaurant is a must.  Find your favorite cuisine here.<br />
        <button onclick="location.href='/Date/RestaurantIndex'" style="background-color:lightblue">Restaurants</button>
