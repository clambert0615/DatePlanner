<h1>Welcome to the Ultimate Date Night Planner</h1>
<br />
<p>
    Have you ever had a first date and you don't know where to start planning it?  You will be happy to know that
    you have come to the right place.  This website will take the stress out of planning a first date.

<h3>Need an Icebreaker?</h3>
<p>
    First dates are always difficult. You never know what to say or what to talk about.  If you find yourself in this
    position, check out our Icebreakers page.

    <h3>Weather</h3>
    Knowing what the weather is going to be like is critical!  Make sure your date doesn't end up rained out and you
    are attired appropriately. Get a three day weather forecast.

<h3>Unsure what to do?</h3>
<p>
    Planning the perfect date is always difficult, especially if you don't really know the other person.  How about
    looking for an event, movie, activity or restaurant.

        <h5>Events</h5>

        Going to an event is always a fun idea.  From a music concert to a sports game, there is always something to do! <br />
        <button onclick="location.href='/Date/EventIndex'" style="background-color:lightblue">Events</button>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
        <h5>Movies</h5>

        Movies are always a safe bet.  Many first dates start with a movie and seeing a movie is perfect if you are shy
        or really don't know your date's interests.<br />
        <button onclick="location.href='/Date/MovieIndex'" style="background-color:lightblue">Movies</button>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
        <h5>Activity</h5>

        If you prefer something a little more active and know some of your date's interests, an activity is the perfect
        date for you. You can go compete in a game of bowling or golf, go to a museum, go to the beach, or whatever other
        activity you can think of.<br />
        <button onclick="location.href='/Date/ActivityIndex'" style="background-color:lightblue">Activities</button>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
        <h5>Restaurants</h5>

        No date is complete without something to eat. Either before you go see that movie or after a game of bowling,
        going to a restaurant is a must.  Find your favorite cuisine here.<br />
